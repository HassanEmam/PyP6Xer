## 📦 Installation

Install from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install PyP6XER
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HassanEmam/PyP6Xer.git
cd PyP6Xer
pip install -e .
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from xerparser.reader import Reader

# Load an XER file
xer = Reader("project.xer")

# Access projects
for project in xer.projects:
    print(f"Project: {project.proj_short_name}")
    print(f"Activities: {len(project.activities)}")
    
    # Access activities in the project
    for activity in project.activities:
        print(f"  {activity.task_code}: {activity.task_name}")
        print(f"  Duration: {activity.duration} days")
        print(f"  Status: {activity.status_code}")
```

### Resource Analysis

```python
# Analyze resource utilization
for resource in xer.resources:
    assignments = [a for a in xer.activityresources if a.rsrc_id == resource.rsrc_id]
    total_hours = sum(a.target_qty or 0 for a in assignments)
    
    print(f"Resource: {resource.rsrc_name}")
    print(f"Total Assigned Hours: {total_hours}")
    print(f"Assignments: {len(assignments)}")
```

### Critical Path Analysis

```python
# Find critical activities
critical_activities = []
for activity in xer.activities:
    if activity.total_float_hr_cnt is not None and activity.total_float_hr_cnt <= 0:
        critical_activities.append(activity)

print(f"Critical Path: {len(critical_activities)} activities")
for activity in critical_activities:
    print(f"  {activity.task_code}: {activity.task_name}")
```

### Schedule Quality Check

```python
# Check for schedule quality issues
issues = []

# Activities without predecessors (except start milestones)
no_predecessors = [a for a in xer.activities 
                  if not a.predecessors and a.task_type != "TT_Mile"]
if len(no_predecessors) > 1:
    issues.append(f"Multiple start activities: {len(no_predecessors)}")

# Long duration activities
long_activities = [a for a in xer.activities 
                  if a.duration and a.duration > 20]
if long_activities:
    issues.append(f"Long duration activities (>20 days): {len(long_activities)}")

# Report issues
if issues:
    print("Schedule Quality Issues:")
    for issue in issues:
        print(f"  • {issue}")
```

### Data Export

```python
# Modify data and export
for activity in xer.activities:
    if activity.status_code == "TK_Active":
        # Update progress for active activities
        activity.phys_complete_pct = 25.0

# Write to new XER file
xer.write("updated_project.xer")
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Schedule Analysis Tools

```python
from xerparser.reader import Reader

def analyze_project_performance(xer_file):
    xer = Reader(xer_file)
    
    for project in xer.projects:
        activities = project.activities
        
        # Calculate performance metrics
        total_activities = len(activities)
        completed = len([a for a in activities if a.status_code == "TK_Complete"])
        in_progress = len([a for a in activities if a.status_code == "TK_Active"])
        
        completion_rate = (completed / total_activities) * 100
        
        print(f"Project: {project.proj_short_name}")
        print(f"Completion: {completion_rate:.1f}%")
        print(f"Active: {in_progress} activities")
```

### Resource Optimization

```python
def find_overallocated_resources(xer):
    """Find resources that are over-allocated."""
    
    overallocated = []
    
    for resource in xer.resources:
        if resource.rsrc_type != "RT_Labor":
            continue
            
        assignments = [a for a in xer.activityresources if a.rsrc_id == resource.rsrc_id]
        
        # Simple over-allocation check (assumes 40 hours/week)
        total_hours = sum(a.target_qty or 0 for a in assignments)
        max_available = 2080  # 40 hours * 52 weeks
        
        if total_hours > max_available:
            overallocated.append({
                'resource': resource,
                'allocated_hours': total_hours,
                'excess_hours': total_hours - max_available
            })
    
    return overallocated
```

### Earned Value Management

```python
def calculate_earned_value_metrics(project, xer):
    """Calculate EVM metrics for a project."""
    
    planned_value = 0
    earned_value = 0
    actual_cost = 0
    
    for activity in project.activities:
        assignments = [a for a in xer.activityresources if a.task_id == activity.task_id]
        
        activity_planned = sum(a.target_cost or 0 for a in assignments)
        activity_actual = sum((a.act_reg_cost or 0) + (a.act_ot_cost or 0) for a in assignments)
        
        if activity.phys_complete_pct:
            activity_earned = activity_planned * (activity.phys_complete_pct / 100)
        else:
            activity_earned = 0
        
        planned_value += activity_planned
        earned_value += activity_earned
        actual_cost += activity_actual
    
    # Calculate performance indices
    cpi = earned_value / actual_cost if actual_cost > 0 else 0
    spi = earned_value / planned_value if planned_value > 0 else 0
    
    return {
        'planned_value': planned_value,
        'earned_value': earned_value,
        'actual_cost': actual_cost,
        'cpi': cpi,
        'spi': spi
    }
```

├── activities (Tasks collection)
│   └── Task
│       ├── resources (resource assignments)
│       ├── predecessors (predecessor relationships)
│       ├── successors (successor relationships)
│       └── activitycodes (activity code assignments)
├── resources (Resources collection)
